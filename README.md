Welcome to Image Cryptor! This tool allows you to encrypt images using pixel manipulation. It's a simple yet effective way to secure your images from unauthorized access.

Features:
Encrypt images using pixel manipulation using a sequence of 3 integers as the encryption key.
Decrypt encrypted images with the correct key or password.
Menu-based interface for ease of use.
Recursive design for seamless navigation.
Handles both single-key and multiple-key encryption for added security.
Provides flexibility with user input for image path and encryption key.

Usage:
Copy the program code to your code editor.
Check for the requirements as mentioned below, beforehand.
Run the program.
Follow the on-screen instructions:-

Choose option 1 to encrypt an image.
Enter the path to the image file when prompted.
Enter a sequence of 3 integers (0 < key < 256) as the encryption key.
Once the encryption process is complete, the encrypted image will be saved as crypted_image.png in the program directory.
To decrypt an encrypted image, follow the same steps as above, that is, encrypt the crypted image again with the same keys.
To exit, choose option 2.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pillow (PIL) library
NumPy library
